<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how 
        people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that 
        these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern 
        life. 
        To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view? </h1>
 
  <p>It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem 
    incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some 
    traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should 
    not be forgotten. </p>
    <p>On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are 
    becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people 
    were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s 
    workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the 
    same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults 
    make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the 
    greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes 
    towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as 
    breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or 
    appropriate by most younger people. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable 
    to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance 
    to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these 
    behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive 
    job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are 
    politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect 
    to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is 
    more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that 
    young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense 
    of community and neighbourliness. </p>
    <p>In conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem 
    unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as 
    irrelevant. </p>
