<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the 
        key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other 
        measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss 
        both these views and give your own opinion.</h1>
 
  <p>People have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our 
    roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can 
    be used together to promote better driving habits. </p>
    <p>On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to 
    drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, 
    meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various 
    types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver 
    awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these 
    punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative 
    consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more 
    disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several 
    different ways that do not punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to 
    educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in 
    schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. 
    Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, 
    signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be 
    added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from 
    driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road 
    accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer 
    people would need to travel by car. </p>
    <p>In conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, I believe that 
    other road safety measures should also be introduced. </p>
