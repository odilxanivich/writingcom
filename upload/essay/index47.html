<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people 
can study online. Is this a positive or negative development? </h1><p>It is true that online courses are becoming a common feature of university 
education. Although there are some drawbacks of Internet-based learning, I 
would argue that there are far more benefits. </p><p>The main drawback of the trend towards online university courses is that there 
is less direct interaction. Students may not have the opportunity to engage 
face-to-face with their teachers, and will instead have to rely on written forms of 
communication. Similarly, students who study online do not come into direct 
contact with each other, and this could have a negative impact on peer 
support, discussion and exchange of ideas. For example, whereas students on 
traditional courses can attend seminars and even discuss their subjects over 
coffee after lessons, online learners are restricted to chatting through website 
forum areas. These learners may also lack the motivation and element of 
competition that face-to-face group work brings. </p><p>Despite the negatives mentioned above, I believe that online university 
courses are a positive development for various reasons. Firstly, they allow 
learners to study in a flexible way, meaning that they can work whenever and 
wherever is convenient, and they can cover the material at their own pace. 
Secondly, the cost of a university education can be greatly reduced, while 
revenues for institutions may increase as more students can be taught. Finally, 
online learning offers open access to anybody who is willing to study, 
regardless of age, location, ability and background. For example, my uncle, 
who is 65 years old, has recently enrolled on an online MBA course in a 
different country, which would have been impossible in the days before 
Internet-based education. </p><p>In conclusion, while I recognise the possible disadvantages of online learning, I 
consider it to be a positive development overall.</p>
