<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, 
rather than in large, extended family groups. Is this a positive or negative trend? </h1><p>It is true that cities are seeing a rise in smaller families and one-person households, 
while the extended family is becoming a rarity. In my opinion, this is a negative 
development. </p><p>As families become smaller, the traditional family support network is disappearing, 
and this can have a negative impact on children as they grow up. In a nuclear family 
or single-parent household, childcare becomes an expensive and stressful part of 
daily life. Without the help of grandparents or aunts and uncles, busy parents must 
rely on babysitters, nannies and after-school clubs to take care of younger children, 
while older children may be left alone after school and during holidays. The absence 
of adult family members can mean that friends, television and the Internet become 
the primary influences on children’s behaviour. It is no surprise that the decline of the 
extended family has been linked to a rise in psychological and behavioural problems 
amongst young people. </p><p>The trend towards people living alone is perhaps even more damaging because of 
the psychological effects of reduced human interaction. Individuals who live on their 
own have nobody to talk to in person, so they cannot share problems or discuss the 
highs and lows of daily life. They forgo the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle 
of a large family, and are left to their own devices for extended periods of time. The 
lack of human contact in the home is necessarily replaced by passive distractions, 
such as television, video games, online chat rooms or Internet surfing. This type of 
existence is associated with boredom, loneliness, and feelings of isolation or even 
alienation, all of which are factors that are known to increase the risk of mental illness. </p><p> conclusion, I believe that individuals thrive when they are part of larger family 
groups, and so it is worrying that many people are choosing to live alone or in such 
small family units.</p>
