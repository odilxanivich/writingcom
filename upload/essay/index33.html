<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people think that all university students should study whatever they 
        like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that 
        will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and 
        technology.
        Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. </h1>
 
  <p>People have different views about how much choice students should have with 
    regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be 
    better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that 
    everyone should be able to study the course of their choice. </p>
    <p>There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only 
    offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university 
    courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely 
    to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can 
    be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career 
    progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for 
    students who take them. On the societal level, by forcing people to choose 
    particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and 
    skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher 
    education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future 
    prosperity. </p>
    <p>In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to 
    choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if 
    our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody 
    can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in 
    the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills 
    above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would 
    need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or 
    technology. </p>
    <p>In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on 
    the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people 
    have the right to study whatever they like. </p>
