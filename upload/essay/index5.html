   <h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best 
          route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a 
          job straight after school.
          Discuss both views and give your opinion.</h1>
 
    <p>When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or
      continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight 
      after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.</p>
      <p>The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. 
      Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this
      way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own 
      house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to 
      find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They 
      will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to
      their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue
      their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. 
      For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without 
      having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to
      more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than 
      those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming 
      increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for 
      one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from
      a university or college will not be able to compete.</p>
      <p>For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely
      to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school 
      level.</p>
