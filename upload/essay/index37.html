<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Although more and more people read news on the Internet, newspapers 
will remain the most important source of news. Do you agree or disagree? </h1><p>The Internet is beginning to rival newspapers as the best place to find 
information about what is happening in the world. I believe that this trend will 
continue, and the Internet will soon be just as important as the traditional 
press. </p><p>On the one hand, I believe that newspapers will continue to be a vital source of 
information, even in the Internet age. Firstly, newspapers are the most 
traditional means of communicating the news, and not everyone wants to or is 
able to use the Internet instead. For example, old people or those in rural areas 
might not have the ability or opportunity to get online, while many of us simply 
prefer newspapers even if we do have Internet access. Secondly, newspapers 
can be trusted as reliable sources of news because they employ professional 
journalists and editors. Finally, many people like the experience of holding and 
reading a paper rather than looking at a computer screen. </p><p>However, the Internet is likely to become just as popular as newspapers for a 
variety of reasons. The main reason is that it allows us much faster access to 
news in real time and wherever we are, on different gadgets and mobile 
devices. Another key benefit of online news compared to newspapers is the 
ability to share articles, discuss them with other people, give our views, and 
even contribute with our own updates on social media. For example, there has 
been an explosion in the use of platforms like Twitter and YouTube where 
anyone can share their news and views. A final point is that this source of 
news is less damaging to the environment. </p><p>In conclusion, I disagree with the view that newspapers will continue to be the 
main source of news, because I believe that the Internet will soon be equally 
important </p>
