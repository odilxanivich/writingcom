<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being 
increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that 
these measures restrict our individual freedom.
Do the benefits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks? </h1><p>It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in 
recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of 
privacy, I believe that the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks. </p><p>There are two main reasons why people might disapprove of the use of video 
cameras in public places. The first objection is that these cameras invade our 
privacy, in the sense that we are constantly being watched by the authorities or 
by private security firms. Many people find this intrusive and feel that the 
recording of their movements is a form of state control that curtails their 
individual freedom. The second argument against the proliferation of CCTV 
cameras is that they are being used as an alternative to police officers 
patrolling the streets. If this is indeed happening, then it is unlikely that 
members of the public will feel safer. </p><p>In spite of the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that the use of video 
cameras to monitor public areas is a positive measure. The key objective of 
video surveillance is to deter criminals and to prevent crime. For example, 
petty criminals like shoplifters and pickpockets are less likely to operate in 
parts of cities where they know that they are being watched. At the same time, 
when crimes are committed, the police can use video evidence to catch and 
prosecute offenders. Therefore, in my view, video cameras offer valuable 
support to police officers, and they make cities safer for inhabitants, workers 
and visitors alike. </p><p>In conclusion, it seems to me that we gain more than we lose from the enhanced 
security that CCTV cameras bring to our cities. </p>
