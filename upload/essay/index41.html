<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Many governments think that economic progress is their most important 
goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally 
important for a country. 
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. </h1><p>People have different views about how governments should measure their 
countries’ progress. While economic progress is of course essential, I agree 
with those who believe that other measures of progress are just as important. 
There are three key reasons why economic growth is seen as a fundamental 
goal for countries. Firstly, a healthy economy results in job creation, a high 
level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens. Secondly, economic 
progress ensures that more money is available for governments to spend on 
infrastructure and public services. For example, a government with higher 
revenues can invest in the country's transport network, its education system 
and its hospitals. Finally, a strong economy can help a country’s standing on 
the global stage, in terms of its political influence and trading power. </p><p>However, I would argue that various other forms of progress are just as 
significant as the economic factors mentioned above. In particular, we should 
consider the area of social justice, human rights, equality and democracy itself. 
For example, the treatment of minority groups is often seen as a reflection of 
the moral standards and level of development of a society. Perhaps another 
key consideration when judging the progress of a modern country should be 
how well that country protects the natural environment, and whether it is 
moving towards environmental sustainability. Alternatively, the success of a 
nation could be measured by looking at the health, well-being and happiness 
of its residents. </p><p>In conclusion, the economy is obviously a key marker of a country’s success, 
but social, environmental and health criteria are equally significant.</p>
