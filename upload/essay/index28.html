<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a 
        waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree? </h1>
 
    <p>Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild 
      animals because we humans have no need for them. I completely disagree with 
      this point of view. </p>
      <p>In my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21st 
      century. I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans, 
      and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we 
      suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. 
      Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. 
      We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to 
      feed or accommodate the world’s population. 
      There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this 
      should be our aim. </p>
      <p>I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. It 
      is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild 
      animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for 
      human survival. For example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon 
      dioxide and stabilise the Earth’s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs 
      of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs 
      of conservation. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the 
      natural balance of all life on Earth. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should 
      exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.</p>
