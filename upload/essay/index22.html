<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Economic progress is often used to measure a country's success. However, 
        some people believe that other factors are more important. What other 
        factors should also be considered when measuring a country's success? Do 
        you think one factor is more important than others?</h1>
 
    <p>The relative success of different countries is usually defined in economic terms. There 
      are several other factors, apart from the economy, that could be used to assess a 
      country, and in my opinion education is the most important of all. </p>
      <p>Standards of education, health and individual human rights should certainly be 
      considered when measuring a country’s status. A good education system is vital for 
      the development of any nation, with schools, colleges and universities bearing the 
      responsibility for the quality of future generations of workers. Healthcare provision is 
      also an indicator of the standard of living within a country, and this can be measured 
      by looking at average life expectancy rates or availability of medical services. Finally, 
      human rights and levels of equality could be taken into account. For example, a 
      country in which women do not have the same opportunities as men might be 
      considered less successful than a country with better gender equality. </p>
      <p>In my view, a country’s education system should be seen as the most important 
      indicator of its success and level of development. This is because education has a 
      considerable effect on the other two factors mentioned above. It affects people’s 
      health in the sense that doctors and nurses need to be trained, and scientists need to 
      be educated to the highest levels before they can carry out medical research. It also 
      affects the economy in the sense that a well-educated workforce will allow a variety 
      of companies and industries to flourish, leading to trade with other countries, and 
      increased wealth. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, nations can be assessed and compared in a variety of ways, but I 
      would argue that the standard of a country's education system is the best measure of 
      its success.</p>
