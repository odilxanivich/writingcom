<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than 
        for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. 
        To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? </h1>
 
    <p>It is true that some celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyles rather 
      than for the work they do. While I agree that these celebrities set a bad 
      example for children, I believe that other famous people act as positive role 
      models. </p>
      <p>On the one hand, many people do achieve fame without really working for it. 
      They may have inherited money from parents, married a famous or wealthy 
      person, or they may have appeared in gossip magazines or on a reality TV 
      programme. A good example would be Paris Hilton, who is rich and famous for 
      the wrong reasons. She spends her time attending parties and nightclubs, and 
      her behaviour promotes the idea that appearance, glamour and media profile 
      are more important than hard work and good character. The message to young 
      people is that success can be achieved easily, and that school work is not 
      necessary. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, there are at least as many celebrities whose 
      accomplishments make them excellent role models for young people. Actors, 
      musicians and sports stars become famous idols because they have worked 
      hard and applied themselves to develop real skills and abilities. They 
      demonstrate great effort, determination and ambition, which is required for 
      someone who wants to be truly successful in their chosen field. An example is 
      the actor and martial artist Jackie Chan, who has become world famous 
      through years of practice and hard work. This kind of self-made celebrity can 
      inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, it seems to me that the influence of celebrities on young people 
      can be positive as well as negative.</p>
