<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and 
        historical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this 
        opinion? </h1>
 
    <p>It is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than 
      local residents to visit important sites and monuments. I completely disagree 
      with this idea. </p>
      <p>The argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that 
      cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them 
      going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these 
      sites through the tax system. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted 
      view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the 
      money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, 
      souvenirs, accommodation and travel. The governments and inhabitants of 
      every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and 
      encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them. </p>
      <p>If travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and 
      cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go 
      to that country on holiday. To take the UK as an example, the tourism industry 
      and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like 
      Windsor Castle or Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same 
      price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural 
      heritage. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would 
      be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important 
      buildings. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from 
      overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local 
      residents. </p>
