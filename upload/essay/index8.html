<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken 
        by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments
        should spend public money on saving these languages, while others 
        believe that would be a waste of money.
        Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</h1>
  
     <p>It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. 
      Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this 
      to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.</p>
  <p>There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a 
      waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of 
      people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that 
      more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers and 
      marketing. This money might be better spent on other public services. 
      Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have
      just one language. Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to 
      communicating with each minority group.</p>
  <p>Despite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve
      languages that are less widely spoken. A language is much more than simply a 
      means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the 
      people who speak it. If a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear 
      with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more 
      interesting. By spending money to protect minority languages, governments can 
      also preserve traditions, customs and behaviours that are part of a country’s 
      history.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority 
      languages to disappear, but in the long term this would have an extremely 
      negative impact on our cultural heritage.</p>
