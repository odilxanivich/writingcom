<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to 
find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree? </h1><p>Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but some people 
argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I completely disagree 
with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue 
and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate. </p><p>There are various measures that governments and individuals could take to 
prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change. Governments could introduce 
laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They 
could impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, 
and they could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water 
power. As individuals, we should also try to limit our contribution to climate 
change, by becoming more energy efficient, by flying less, and by using 
bicycles and public transport. Furthermore, the public can affect the actions of 
governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change, 
rather than for those who would prefer to ignore it. </p><p>If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate 
change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one 
example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with even a small 
rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly 
in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These 
people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to 
migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. The potential for human 
suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease 
and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty. </p><p>In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem of climate 
change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with 
it. </p>
