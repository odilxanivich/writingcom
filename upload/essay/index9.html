<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in
        every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</h1>
 
    
      <p>In my opinion, men and women should have the same educational 
        opportunities. However, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal 
        proportions of each gender in every university subject.</p>
        <p>Having the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply 
            unrealistic. Student numbers on any course depend on the applications that 
            the institution receives. If a university decided to fill courses with equal 
            numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each
            gender. In reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the 
            other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. For example, 
            nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be 
            difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to 
            males.</p>
        <p>Apart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would 
            be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender.
            Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course 
            according to their qualifications. In this way, both men and women have the 
            same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they
            work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student is the best 
            candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit,
            and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure 
            based on gender.</p>
