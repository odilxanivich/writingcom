<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on 
        each other, while others think that people have become more 
        independent. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. </h1>
 
    <p>People have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on 
      others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent 
      than people were in the past. </p>
      <p>There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more 
      dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, 
      especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For 
      example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a 
      house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be 
      impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, 
      people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of 
      life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full
      time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child 
      care. </p>
      <p>However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more 
      independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and 
      more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as 
      they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our 
      home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of 
      going to their local university, and this experience makes them more 
      independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing 
      independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of 
      the world. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend 
      on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever. </p>
