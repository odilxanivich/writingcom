<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain
          people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
          Discuss both views and give you own opinion.</h1>
 
    <p>People have different views about the role and function of museums. In my 
      opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to 
      entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection 
      of interesting objects that many people will want to see. The average visitor may 
      become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content,
      so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. 
      This type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have
      interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on 
      education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that 
      they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the
      museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various 
      ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors,
      while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed 
      commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important 
      role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects 
      of life.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an 
      interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that people can have fun 
      and learn something at the same time.</p>
