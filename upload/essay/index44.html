<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are very dangerous and 
should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this 
view? </h1><p>In recent years, extreme sports have become increasingly popular, and some 
people argue that governments should prohibit them. I completely disagree with 
the idea that these sports are too dangerous, and I therefore believe that they 
should not be banned. </p><p>In my opinion, so-called extreme sports are not as dangerous as many people 
think. All sports involve some element of risk, and there should always be clear 
regulations and safety procedures to reduce the possibility of accidents. 
People who take part in extreme sports are usually required to undergo 
appropriate training so that the dangers are minimised. For example, anyone 
who wants to try skydiving will need to sign up for lessons with a registered 
club, and beginners are not allowed to dive solo; they must be accompanied 
by an experienced professional. Finally, the protective equipment and 
technology used in sports from motor racing to mountain climbing is constantly 
improving safety. </p><p>While I support regulations and safety measures, I believe that it would be 
wrong, and almost impossible, to ban extreme sports. In the first place, we 
should all be free to decide how we spend our leisure time; as long as we 
understand the risks, I do not believe that politicians should stop us from 
enjoying ourselves. However, an even stronger argument against such a ban 
would be the difficulty of enforcing it. Many of the most risky sports, like base 
jumping or big wave surfing, are practised far away from the reach of any 
authorities. I cannot imagine the police being called to stop people from 
parachuting off a mountain face or surfing on an isolated beach. </p><p>In conclusion, I would argue that people should be free to enjoy extreme sports 
as long as they understand the risks and take the appropriate precautions.</p>
