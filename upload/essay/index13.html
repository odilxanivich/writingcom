<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Many people decide on a career path early in their lives and keep to it. This, 
        they argue, leads to a more satisfying working life. 
        To what extent do you agree with this view?
        What other things can people do in order to have a satisfying working life? </h1>
 
    <p>It is true that some people know from an early age what career they want to pursue, 
      and they are happy to spend the rest of their lives in the same profession. While I 
      accept that this may suit many people, I believe that others enjoy changing careers 
      or seeking job satisfaction in different ways. </p>
      <p>On the one hand, having a defined career path can certainly lead to a satisfying 
      working life. Many people decide as young children what they want to do as adults, 
      and it gives them a great sense of satisfaction to work towards their goals and 
      gradually achieve them. For example, many children dream of becoming doctors, 
      but to realise this ambition they need to gain the relevant qualifications and 
      undertake years of training. In my experience, very few people who have qualified 
      as doctors choose to change career because they find their work so rewarding, and 
      because they have invested so much time and effort to reach their goal. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, people find happiness in their working lives in different ways. 
      Firstly, not everyone dreams of doing a particular job, and it can be equally 
      rewarding to try a variety of professions; starting out on a completely new career 
      path can be reinvigorating experience. Secondly, some people see their jobs as 
      simply a means of earning money, and they are happy if their salary is high enough 
      to allow them to enjoy life outside work. Finally, job satisfaction is often the result of 
      working conditions, rather than the career itself. For example, a positive working 
      atmosphere, enthusiastic colleagues, and an inspirational boss can make working 
      life much more satisfying, regardless of the profession. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, it can certainly be satisfying to pursue a particular career for the whole of 
      one’s life, but this is by no means the only route to fulfilment. </p>
