<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced 
        films. Why could this be?
        Should governments give more financial support to local film industries? </h1>        
 
    <p>It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically 
      produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe 
      that governments should promote local film-making by subsidising the industry. </p>
      <p>There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than 
      the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in 
      certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in 
      spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like ‘Avatar’ or the James Bond films 
      are examples of such productions, and their global appeal is undeniable. Another 
      reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most 
      famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished 
      producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries 
      suffers in comparison. </p>
      <p>In my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every 
      country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the 
      opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from 
      overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other 
      costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, 
      they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film 
      sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has 
      seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly 
      funded by government subsidies.</p> <p>
      In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of 
      locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that 
      currently dominate the market. </p>
