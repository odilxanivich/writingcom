<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but 
city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living 
in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone? </h1><p>Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major 
drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could 
do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant. </p><p>The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the 
cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. 
Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even 
food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems 
such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. 
Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, 
and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a 
result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful. </p><p>However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these 
problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social 
housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to 
ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, 
which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, 
for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to 
curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns 
and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to 
reduce the pressure on major cities. </p><p>In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to 
enhance the quality of life for all city residents.</p>
