<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best 
          route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a 
          job straight after school.
          Discuss both views and give your opinion.</h1>
 
    <p> When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or 
      continue their education. While there are benefits to getting a job straight after
      school, there are also good reasons why it might be beneficial to go to college or university.</p>      
      
      <p>The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. 
          Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this
          way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own 
          house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to 
          find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They 
          will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to
          their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, it is also understandable that many students choose to 
          continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many 
          professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or 
          lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates
          have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher 
          salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is 
          becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of 
          applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have 
          qualifications from a university or college may not be able to compete.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, there are convincing arguments for starting work straight after
              school, but higher education can also lead to a successful career.</p>
