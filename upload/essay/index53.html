<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Caring for children is probably the most important job in any society. Because 
of this, all mothers and fathers should be required to take a course that 
prepares them to be good parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree 
with this view? <h1>
<p>It is true that parents shoulder a huge responsibility and that raising children is by no 
means an easy task. However, I completely disagree with the idea that we should 
therefore force all mothers and fathers to attend parenting courses. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the idea that all future parents should take a parenthood preparation 
course is completely impractical. Many prospective parents have jobs and busy 
schedules, and they may not be willing or able to attend regular parenting classes. 
This raises the question of whether those who missed the classes, or perhaps 
refused to attend, would be punished. I believe that it would be wrong to do this, and 
it would therefore be impossible to enforce the idea of compulsory training for 
parents. Besides, even if parents could be forced to attend, I doubt that people would 
agree on what good parenting entails, and so it would be difficult to create a 
parenting course to suit everyone. </p>
<p>As well as being impractical, I would argue that training courses for parents are 
unnecessary. Mothers and fathers have been raising children without any formal help 
or official interference for thousands of years. Parenting skills are learnt from family 
members, friends, neighbours and the surrounding culture. Perhaps more importantly, 
adults learn to be good parents by instinct, by trial and error, and by getting to know 
their own children; for example, a good parent will try different strategies when faced 
with a badly-behaved child, and will gradually develop an understanding of what works 
to correct the behaviour. None of this requires the intervention of a taught course. </p>
<p>In conclusion, while compulsory parenting lessons might seem like a good idea, I 
believe that such a scheme would be unworkable and largely pointless. </p>
