<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do 
        unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They 
        believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society 
        as a whole. 
        Do you agree or disagree?</h1>
 
    <p>Many young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial 
      for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do not agree that we 
      should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work. </p>
      <p>Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, 
      without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. 
      School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their 
      students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every 
      day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to 
      enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. 
      They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies. </p>
      <p>At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from 
      obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes 
      against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do 
      something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst 
      young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who 
      would not want to be told how to raise their children. 
      Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in 
      my opinion we should not make this compulsory.</p>
