<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious 
festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy 
themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? </h1><p>Some people argue that we no longer remember the original meaning of 
festivals, and that most of us treat them as opportunities to have fun. While I 
agree that enjoyment seems to be the priority during festival times, I do not 
agree that people have forgotten what these festivals mean. </p><p>On the one hand, religious and traditional festivals have certainly become 
times for celebration. In the UK, Christmas is a good example of a festival 
period when people are most concerned with shopping, giving and receiving 
presents, decorating their homes and enjoying traditional meals with their 
families. Most people look forward to Christmas as a holiday period, rather 
than a time to practise religion. Similar behaviour can be seen during non
religious festivals, such as Bonfire Night. People associate this occasion with 
making fires, watching firework displays, and perhaps going to large events in 
local parks; in other words, enjoyment is people’s primary goal. </p><p>However, I disagree with the idea that the underlying meaning of such festivals 
has been forgotten. In UK primary schools, children learn in detail about the 
religious reasons for celebrating Christmas, Easter and a variety of festivals in 
other religions. For example, in late December, children sing Christmas songs 
which have a religious content, and they may even perform nativity plays telling 
the story of Jesus’ birth. Families also play a role in passing knowledge of 
religious festivals’ deeper significance on to the next generation. The same is 
true for festivals that have a historical background, such as Bonfire Night or 
Halloween, in the sense that people generally learn the stories behind these 
occasions at an early age. </p><p>In conclusion, although people mainly want to enjoy themselves during festivals, 
I believe that they are still aware of the reasons for these celebrations. </p>
