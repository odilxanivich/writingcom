<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. 
Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. To what extent do 
you agree or disagree with this view? </h1><p>Some people believe that technological developments lead to the loss of 
traditional cultures. I partly agree with this assertion; while it may be true in the 
case of some societies, others seem to be unaffected by technology and the 
modern world. <p>
<p>On the one hand, the advances in technology that have driven industrialisation 
in developed countries have certainly contributed to the disappearance of 
traditional ways of life. For example, in pre-industrial Britain, generations of 
families grew up in the same small village communities. These communities 
had a strong sense of identity, due to their shared customs and beliefs. 
However, developments in transport, communications and manufacturing led 
to the dispersal of families and village communities as people moved to the 
cities in search of work. <p>
<p>Nowadays most British villages are inhabited by commuters, many of whom 
do not know their closest neighbours. 
On the other hand, in some parts of the world traditional cultures still thrive. 
There are tribes in the Amazon Rainforest, for example, that have been 
completely untouched by the technological developments of the developed 
world. These tribal communities continue to hunt and gather food from the 
forest, and traditional skills are passed on to children by parents and elders. 
Other traditional cultures, such as farming communities in parts of Africa, are 
embracing communications technologies. Mobile phones give farmers access 
to information, from weather predictions to market prices, which helps them to 
prosper and therefore supports their culture. </p>
<p>In conclusion, many traditional ways of life have been lost as a result of 
advances in technology, but other traditional communities have survived and 
even flourished.</p>
