<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">These days more fathers stay at home and take care of their children while 
        mothers go out to work. What could be the reasons for this? Do you think 
        it is a positive or a negative development?</h1>
 
  <p>It is true that men are increasingly likely to take on the role of househusband, 
    while more women than ever are the breadwinners in their families. There could 
    be several reasons for this, and I consider it to be a very positive trend. </p>
    <p>In recent years, parents have had to adapt to various changes in our societies. 
    Equal rights movements have made great progress, and it has become normal 
    for women to gain qualifications and pursue a career. It has also become 
    socially acceptable for men to stay at home and look after their children. At the 
    same time, the rising cost of living has meant that both marriage partners 
    usually need to work and save money before starting a family. Therefore, 
    when couples have children, they may decide who works and who stays at 
    home depending on the personal preference of each partner, or based on 
    which partner earns the most money. </p>
    <p>In my view, the changes described above should be seen as progress. We 
    should be happy to live in a society in which men and women have equal 
    opportunities, and in which women are not put under pressure to sacrifice their 
    careers. Equally, it seems only fair that men should be free to leave their jobs 
    in order to assume childcare responsibilities if this is what they wish to do. 
    Couples should be left to make their own decisions about which parental role 
    each partner takes, according to their particular circumstances and needs.</p>
    
    <p>In conclusion, the changing roles of men and women in the family are a result 
    of wider changes in society, and I believe that these developments are 
    desirable. </p>
