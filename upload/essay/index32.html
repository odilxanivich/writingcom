<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it 
        is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about 
        the dangers of committing a crime. 
        To what extent do you agree or disagree?</h1>
 
  <p>It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of 
    society. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to 
    teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from 
    breaking the law. </p>
    <p>In my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who 
    can speak from experience. Reformed offenders can tell young people about 
    how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and 
    what life in prison is really like. They can also dispel any ideas that teenagers 
    may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. 
    While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, I 
    imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex
    offender. The vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have 
    a powerful impact. </p>
    <p>The alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime 
    would be much less effective. One option would be for police officers to visit 
    schools and talk to young people. This could be useful in terms of informing 
    teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young 
    people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. A second 
    option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but 
    I doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information 
    about this topic. Finally, educational films might be informative, but there would 
    be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions. </p>
    <p>In conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives 
    around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from 
    committing crimes.</p>
