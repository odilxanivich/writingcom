<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Explain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the 
environment. What can governments do to address these problems? What 
can individual people do?
</h1>
<p>Humans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can 
also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to the planet. This
essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments 
and individuals can take to address these problems.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. Gas 
emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global 
warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. As 
the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities 
of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.</p>
<p>Governments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. They 
could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to 
use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. They could also 
impose ‘green taxes’ on drivers and airline companies. In this way, people 
would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, 
therefore reducing emissions.</p>
<p>Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the 
environment. They can take public transport rather than driving, choose 
products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Most 
supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as ‘banks’ for 
recycling glass, plastic and paper in their car parks. By reusing and recycling, 
we can help to reduce waste.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in 
looking after the environment.
