<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some parents buy their children whatever they ask for, and allow their 
children to do whatever they want. Is this a good way to raise children? 
What consequences could this style of parenting have for children as 
they get older? </h1><p>It is true that some parents are overly permissive and tend to spoil their 
children. In my opinion, this is not a good parenting style, and it can have a 
range of negative long-term consequences. </p><p>If parents want to raise respectful and well-behaved children, I believe that a 
certain amount of discipline is necessary. Having worked with children myself, 
I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary, and it is 
important to be able to say ‘no’ to children when they misbehave or try to push 
against these boundaries. This is the only way to help young people to 
regulate their desires and develop self-control. In my view, parents who do the 
opposite and constantly give in to their children’s demands, are actually doing 
more harm than good. They are failing their children rather than being kind to 
them. </p><p>The children of indulgent or lenient parents are likely to grow up with several 
negative personality traits. The first and most obvious danger is that these 
children will become self-centred adults who show little consideration for the 
feelings or needs of others. One consequence of such an attitude could be 
that these adults are unable to work successfully in teams with other 
colleagues. A second negative trait in such people could be impulsiveness. A 
person who has never lived with any boundaries is likely to lack the patience to 
carefully consider options before making decisions. This may lead, for 
example, to compulsive shopping, unwise financial decisions, or even criminal 
activity. </p><p>In conclusion, parents should help their children to develop self-control and 
respect for others, and I do not believe that the permissive parenting style 
supports this objective.</p>
