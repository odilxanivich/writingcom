<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. 
Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that 
governments should not allow salaries above a certain level. 
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. </h1><p>People have different views about whether governments should introduce a 
maximum wage. While in some ways it may seem reasonable to allow people 
to earn as much as companies are willing to pay, I personally believe that 
employee remuneration should be capped at a certain level. 
There are various reasons why it might be considered beneficial to allow 
people to be paid extremely high salaries. If companies offer excellent pay 
packages, they can attract the most talented people in their fields to work for 
them. For example, technology companies like Google are able to employ the 
best programmers because of the huge sums that they are willing to pay. 
Furthermore, these well-paid employees are likely to be highly motivated to 
work hard and therefore drive their businesses successfully. In theory, this 
should result in a thriving economy and increased tax revenues, which means 
that paying high salaries benefits everyone. </p><p>However, I agree with those who argue that there should be a maximum wage. 
By introducing a limit on earnings, the pay-gap between bosses and 
employees can be reduced. Currently, the difference between normal and top 
salaries is huge, and this can demotivate workers who feel that the situation is 
unfair. With lower executive salaries, it might become feasible to introduce 
higher minimum wages, and everybody would be better off. 
One possible consequence of greater equality could be that poverty and crime 
rates fall because the general population will experience an improved 
standard of living. </p><p>In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be better, on balance, for 
governments to set a limit on the wages of the highest earners in society. </p>
