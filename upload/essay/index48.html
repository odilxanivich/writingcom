<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people believe that school children should not be given homework 
by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important 
role in the education of children. Discuss both of these views and give 
your own opinion. </h1><p>People’s opinions differ as to whether or not school children should be given 
homework. While there are some strong arguments against the setting of 
homework, I still believe that it is a necessary aspect of education.</p><p>There are several reasons why people might argue that homework is an 
unnecessary burden on children. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea 
that homework does nothing to improve educational outcomes. 
Countries such as Finland, where school children are not given homework, 
regularly top international educational league tables and outperform nations 
where setting homework is the norm. Secondly, many parents would agree 
that the school day is already long enough, and leaves their children too tired 
to do further study when they return home. Finally, it is recognised that play 
time is just as beneficial as study time from the perspective of brain 
development. </p><p>In spite of the above arguments, I support the view that homework has an 
important role to play in the schooling of children. The main benefit of 
homework is that it encourages independent learning and problem solving, as 
children are challenged to work through tasks alone and at their own pace. In 
doing so, students must apply the knowledge that they have learnt in the 
classroom. For example, by doing mathematics exercises at home, students 
consolidate their understanding of the concepts taught by their teacher at 
school. In my view, it is important for children to develop an independent study 
habit because this prepares them to work alone as adults. </p><p>In conclusion, homework certainly has its drawbacks, but I believe that the 
benefits outweigh them in the long term.</p>
