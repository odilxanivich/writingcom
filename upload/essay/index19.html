<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What 
        problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some 
        measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.</h1>
 
    <p>It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever 
      before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this 
      trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems. </p>
      <p>As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, 
      several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will 
      obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a 
      pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and 
      governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of 
      the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax 
      burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand 
      for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after 
      their elderly relatives. </p>
      <p>There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems 
      described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement 
      age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age 
      tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second 
      measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to 
      increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from 
      national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital 
      healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of 
      older citizens. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are 
      certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older. </p>
