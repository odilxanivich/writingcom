<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Popular hobbies and interests change over time and are more a reflection of 
trends and fashions than an indication of what individuals really want to do in 
their spare time. To what extent do you agree or disagree? </h1><p>Some leisure activities become fashionable for a short time and then disappear 
when a new trend comes along, whereas others seem to be perennially popular. I 
can therefore only partly agree with the assertion that hobbies reflect changing 
fashions rather than our true interests.</p><p>On the one hand, it is true that many hobbies are simply passing trends. Children and 
teenagers, in particular, are attracted to whatever activity is currently popular among 
their peers. My 10-year-old niece, for example, seems to have a new interest every 
month, as she joins in with the latest craze that sweeps through her primary school. 
Over the last year or so, she has been obsessed with Rubik’s cubes, fidget spinners, 
squidgies and slime. In a similar way, there have been several different fitness trends 
for adults over recent years, from jogging to yoga to circuit training, and I doubt 
whether the majority of participants continued to enjoy those activities in the long 
term.</p><p>On the other hand, many people spend their free time doing popular activities that 
are far from trendy. One good example would be the game chess. Children and 
adults who enjoy playing chess are certainly not following a new fashion or wasting 
their time on something that they do not truly like. On the contrary, they are 
passionate about a game that has existed for hundreds of years, and they find it 
inherently fascinating and absorbing. I would say the same about many other 
hobbies, from reading to swimming. </p><p>In conclusion, while some people are attracted to the latest fashionable hobby, others 
choose their pastimes for more genuine reasons. </p>
