<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people believe that nowadays we have too many choices. To what extent 
do you agree or disagree with this statement? </h1><p>It is often said that modern life presents us with an overwhelming number of choices. I 
completely agree with this, and I believe that the Internet and globalisation are the two 
major factors involved. </p><p>It is undeniable that the Internet has led to a dramatic expansion in the number of 
choices that are available to us. The number of online media options, for instance, is 
now almost endless. There are countless websites offering entertainment, news, 
videos, on-demand TV and music streaming, many of which are free. I would argue 
that this abundance of media leads to confusion on the part of the average user, as 
we have to make so many decisions about the content that we consume. A personal 
example of this trend would be the fact that I had a choice of just four TV channels 
when I was a child, whereas I now have access to thousands of films and series 
through services like Netflix. </p><p>Alongside the influence of the Internet, globalisation is making the world smaller and 
compounding this problem of too much choice. Cheap international flights have 
made overseas travel possible for millions of people, but this also means that we are 
faced with a world of options when deciding where to go on holiday or even where to 
live. We no longer have the limited but simple travel choices of our grandparents’ 
generation. The same is true if we look at the increasing tendency for young people 
to study abroad. While the opportunity for overseas study seems appealing, many 
students are confused about where to go and which path to take. </p><p>In conclusion, we are faced with a huge number of options in most areas of life 
nowadays, and this is often more bewildering than beneficial. </p>
