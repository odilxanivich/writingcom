<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Some people believe that developments in the field of artificial intelligence will 
have a positive impact on our lives in the near future. Others, by contrast, are 
worried that we are not prepared for a world in which computers are more 
intelligent than humans. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion. </h1><p>People seem to be either excited or worried about the future impact of artificial 
intelligence. Personally, I can understand the two opposing points of view; I am both 
fascinated by developments in artificial intelligence and apprehensive about its 
possible negative effects. </p><p>On the one hand, the increasing intelligence of technology should bring some obvious 
benefits. Machines are clearly able to do many jobs better than humans can, 
especially in areas that require high levels of accuracy or calculations using large 
amounts of data. For example, robots are being developed that can carry out surgical 
procedures with greater precision than a human doctor, and we already have cars 
that use sensors and cameras to drive themselves. Such technologies can improve 
safety by reducing the likelihood of human errors. It is easy to imagine how these 
developments, and many others, will steadily improve our quality of life. </p><p>On the other hand, I share the concerns of people who believe that artificial 
intelligence may harm us if we are not careful. In the short term, it is likely that we will 
see a rise in unemployment as workers in various industries are replaced by 
machines or software programs. For example, self-driving vehicles are expected to 
cause redundancies in driving jobs, such as lorry drivers, taxi drivers and bus drivers. 
In the medium term, if intelligent technologies gradually take jobs away from humans, 
we may find that people become deskilled and lose their sense of purpose in life. A 
longer term fear is that computers become so intelligent that they begin to make 
decisions without human oversight and without regard for our well-being. </p><p>In conclusion, while intelligent machines will no doubt improve our lives in many ways, 
the potential risks of such technologies should not be ignored. </p>
