<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Happiness is considered very important in life. Why is 
        it difficult to define? 
        What factors are important in achieving happiness? </h1>
 
    <p>It is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy in their lives. 
      While the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult to describe, there do 
      seem to be some common needs that we all share with regard to experiencing 
      or achieving happiness. </p>
      <p>Happiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each 
      individual person. Nobody can fully understand or experience another person’s 
      feelings, and we all have our own particular passions from which we take 
      pleasure. Some people, for example, derive a sense of satisfaction from 
      earning money or achieving success, whereas for others, health and family are 
      much more important. At the same time, a range of other feelings, from 
      excitement to peacefulness, may be associated with the idea of happiness, 
      and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways. </p>
      <p>Although it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition of happiness, 
      most people would agree that there are some basic preconditions to achieving 
      it. Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe 
      place to live and enough food to eat. Our basic survival needs must surely be 
      met before we can lead a pleasant life. Secondly, the greatest joy in life is 
      usually found in shared experiences with family and friends, and it is rare to 
      find a person who is content to live in complete isolation. Other key factors 
      could be individual freedom and a sense of purpose in life. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular to each 
      individual, but I believe that our basic needs for shelter, food and company 
      need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.</p>
