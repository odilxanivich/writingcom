<h1 style="font-size: 1.3rem;">In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone 
nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative 
development? </h1><p>In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, 
particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could 
have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure. </p><p>The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal 
and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to 
live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live 
with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to 
learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are 
valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly 
be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend 
towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to 
benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other 
companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services. </p><p>However, the personal and economic arguments given above can be 
considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of 
increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of 
loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and 
daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the 
weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the 
trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point 
of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and 
rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, 
including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs. </p><p>In conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial 
and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.</p>
